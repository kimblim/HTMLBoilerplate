# HTMLBoilerplate

This HTML "starter kit" was originally inspired/copied from _Manuel Matuzovic_'s boilerplate, that he wrote [about on his site](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/).

This follows a long tradition of having boilerplates/starting points, the most popular being [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com).
